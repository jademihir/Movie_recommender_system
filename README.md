# Movie_recommender_system

This project is a **Movie Recommender System** that suggests movies based on their similarity in genres, cast, crew, and other features. It is built using **Python, Machine Learning,** and the **TMDB API** for fetching movie posters and additional movie details.

## Project Description

The Movie Recommender System provides personalized movie recommendations. Using a combination of **content-based filtering** and **vector similarity measures**, it delivers suggestions to users based on the selected movie. A user-friendly interface, built using **Streamlit**, enhances the user experience.

## Key Feature:

After a user hits the **Recommend** button, movie posters are displayed along with a **More Info** button. Clicking this button redirects the user to the movieâ€™s page on the **TMDB website**, where they can view the movie's trailer, ratings, and detailed information.
